After 3 years, AlbertOS has now been released with its first major update. AlbertOS REVAMPED has all the
functionality we loved from the original AlbertOS, however it includes many updates that were much needed.
The optimized code has cut down start up times by 75%. All prebundled software, including Notepad, Paint,
and Calculator have major updates. Along with all of that, there were many aesthetic changes that makes
AlbertOS REVAMPED what it is.  Without further ado, and with great privilege, I introduce to you the first 
public release of AlbertOS REVAMPED. Before downloading, please note that AlbertOS REVAMPED requires a
screen resolution of 1366x768 to operate and the latest version of Java, which can be downloaded for free
from java.com. Thank you and enjoy!
